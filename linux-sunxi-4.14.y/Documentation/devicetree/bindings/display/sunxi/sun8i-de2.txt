Allwinner sun8i Display Engine 2 subsystem
==========================================

The Allwinner DE2 subsystem contains a display controller (DE2),
one or two LCD controllers (TCON) and their external interfaces.

Display controller
==================

Required properties:

- compatible: value should be one of the following
		"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-display-engine"
		"allwinner,sun8i-h3-display-engine"

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
		clock-names property.

- clock-names: must contain
		"gate": DE bus gate
		"clock": DE clock

- resets: phandle to the reset of the device

- ports: phandle's to the LCD ports

LCD controller
==============

Required properties:

- compatible: should be
		"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-tcon"

- clocks: must include clock specifiers corresponding to entries in the
		clock-names property.

- clock-names: must contain
		"gate": TCON bus gate
		"clock": TCON pixel clock

- resets: phandle to the reset of the device

- port: port node with endpoint definitions as defined in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

Example:

	de: de-controller@01000000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-display-engine";
		...
		clocks = <&&ccu CLK_BUS_DE>, <&ccu CLK_DE>;
		clock-names = "gate", "clock";
		resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_DE>;
		ports = <&lcd0_p>;
	};

	lcd0: lcd-controller@01c0c000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-tcon";
		...
		clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_TCON0>, <&ccu CLK_TCON0>;
		clock-names = "gate", "clock";
		resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_TCON0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		lcd0_p: port {
			lcd0_ep: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&hdmi_ep>;
			};
		};
	};

	hdmi: hdmi@01ee0000 {
		...
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		port {
			hdmi_ep: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lcd0_ep>;
			};
		};
	};
